# Question: Can we do peer to peer javascript?
Looks like we can! (Although RTCDataChannel may need some handshaking server behind the scenes, need to refactor DataChannel.js)

# Pull Requests are welcome!

Better ui
Better gameplay

Therefore either all bets are off, or gentleman's rule not to use developer tools :)
